# Worksheet 1.0.f2: "The Cat and the Moon"

Now, it's up to you to do the same to the poem contained in the file `w_b_yeats_the_cat_and_the_moon.txt`. Its title is "The Cat and the Moon," and its author: the famous Irish poet W.B. Yeats (pronounced "Yates"). Hopefully you learn something about this meditation on cat behavior.

To reiterate our problem, we need to:

* `open` the file
* `print` the title and author on separate lines, followed by a blank new line
* Then, using our new `f-string`s:
  * `print` the file's contents without spaces between the lines
  * `print` a line number to the left of the line _every five (5) lines_.
    * This will use the new thing we've seen -- the modulus `%` operator.
    * This should be separated by a tab
    * All lines, regardless of being numbered should be spaced in by one tab
* use at least 5 original comments (not copies of the TODO comments)

A tip about this file: the title and author are included in the file, which is different than the file we worked with in the IO notebook. However, fear not! What you know about `list`s should help you.
    
## Notes

---

This work should be completed in the [f2_week-1-worksheet-yeats.py](f2_week-1-worksheet-yeats.py) file. Recall that, during class, this is the way Python development is largely done. While we will still use notebooks like worksheets, when it comes to to real programming jobs, we're going to start getting the habit of programming real programs in `*.py` files.

There's already some code in the file to get you started.
