    "# Week 11, Worksheet 0: Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    This worksheet implements to-do markers where work needs to be completed. In some cases, this means that you'll need to copy a line or two and make meaningful changes.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## The object of the week\n",
    "\n",
    "While we've been using some principles of \"object-oriented programming\" (commonly referred to as \"OOP\"), our work hasn't called too much attention to it. Yes, we know that nearly everything is an _object_ with both _properties_ and _methods_, but what does that really mean? Perhaps the more important question to appreciate: what does that really _look like_?\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we're going to dive into making `modules`, which demonstrate many object-oriented principles that we've learned so far. The ultimate goal of this exercise is only to _begin_ to see the benefits and powers of using a programming language like an architect -- building blueprints rather than structures _directly_, which is partially what we've spent more time doing this semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Very `class`y\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic outline for any given `module` starts with a `class` declaration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# class keyword\n",
    "# |\n",
    "# |    class name\n",
    "# |     |\n",
    "class Cat:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is a `class`?\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a `module`, think of it less like a program and more like a _blueprint_ for something that _should_ or _will_ exist in the future when it's used: it's _planning_. A `class`, then, represents a kind of `object` that you'd like to make for future use. Perhaps this use is program-specific; perhaps it's a `module` that many people will use in writing programs of all types. Either is equally possible and applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see with the above code example, we're back to creating cats. In fact, this week, we're going to create a bunch of cats and have them interact with each other based on a few strict rules of cat culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this worksheet, we'll just focus on how you might create a cat on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A cat, `__init__`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, forgive the British English slang joke. Here's a picture of Ulysses to compensate.\n",
    "\n",
    "![I don't always appear in worksheets, but when I do...](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/dluman/cmpsc100/img/ulysses-reads.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a `class` of object, it's important to tell a program _what to do_ when we've made one. Here, we encounter a series of \"magic\" methods that do special things _if they exist_. We'll focus on two: `__init__` and `__str__`, but `__init__` here, specifically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The moment that we _use_ a fully-developed `class` (called _initialization_ for the vocab folks) Python programs look for specific instructions in a method called `__init__`. If no method by that name exists, the program will continue to run, but we've lost our chance to set up \"defaults.\" Here, let's assume a few default things about cats:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They have a name\n",
    "* They have a predominate fur color scheme\n",
    "* They are or are not tabby cats\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, any time we create a `Cat`, we should at least have the opportunity to specify these this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Our __init__ method -- let's specify some defaults just in case\n",
    "def __init__(self, name, fur_color, is_tabby):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    self.fur_color = fur_color\n",
    "    self.is_tabby = is_tabby\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Talking to my`self`\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one weird thing here, though. What's that `self` _parameter_?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that what we're building here is a blueprint for _all cats_. Each `Cat` we ultimately _initalize_ has different properties: they are different cats! Hence, each `self` refers to the _invidiual copy_ or _instance_ of that cat. To reiterate: because we're creating a template that can be used (theoretically) infinite times, we need to be sure that each copy will only talk abou it`self`!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pulling `__str__`ings\n",
    "\n",
    "Another \"magic\" method of classes exists in the `__str__` function, which gives us the ability to create a default `string` (i.e. `print`able) version of the object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def __str__(self):\n",
    "    tabby = \"tabby\" if self.is_tabby else \"non-tabby\"\n",
    "    return f\"{self.name} is a {self.fur_color} {tabby} cat.\" \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if I _use_ my `Cat` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_cat = Cat(\n",
    "    name = \"Ulysses\", \n",
    "    fur_color = \"brown\", \n",
    "    is_tabby = True\n",
    ")\n",
    "print(my_cat)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print(my_cat)` statement results in the `string`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Ulysses is a brown tabby cat.\n",
    "```"
